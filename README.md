Instructions
===
After cloning the repository, you should first edit this readme to contain  
whatever you want as your template readme.

Second, you need to do a Global Find/Replace of the word `TODO`.  
Every `TODO` should be replaced with what is necessary.

For screenshots of the extension, I will usually just put images on the root  
directory appended by the size.  For example, `product-name-128x128.png`
